    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
        <span class="firstletter">W</span>hen the news broke on May 2 that Northwestern 
        was naming Mike Polisky as its 22nd Athletic Director, a wave of criticism 
        arose from students and faculty alike. They argued that Polisky – who in 
        February was named a defendant in a sexual harassment case filed by former 
        cheerleader Hayden Richardson – was the symbol of a true “boys’ club” at 
        Northwestern, representing a disregard for students’ safety and only caring 
        about the bottom line. University President Morton Schapiro, in a statement 
        released May 7, reaffirmed his decision, saying “the safety and well-being 
        of the Northwestern community is our top priority, and Mike and his Athletics 
        and Recreation leadership team are deeply committed to the same.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t the first time, however, that Northwestern Athletics has been in 
        the spotlight for its handling of student athletes. Since Polisky’s hiring 
        in 2010, there have been several notable examples of media attention 
        surrounding the department for controversies, internal conflicts and ongoing 
        power struggles between the students and higher administration. This timeline, 
        which begins with the hiring of Polisky, aims to summarize and share some of 
        these examples, along with some other notable events within the program, 
        in order to better understand his time with Northwestern.

              MIKE POLISKY HIRED:</span>
              Under then-Athletic Director Jim Phillips, Northwestern hires Polisky 
              as the Deputy Director of Athletics for External Affairs. During his 
              tenure with the program, he worked on advertising and partnerships 
              outside of the University, with his most notable work being a collaboration 
              with the Chicago Cubs. He also coined the slogan “Chicago’s Big Ten Team.” 
              According to his Northwestern athletics bio (now deleted), Polisky’s 
              efforts helped double season ticket sales for both the football team 
              and men’s basketball team and allowed the ’Cats to return to a dominant 
              presence in both the Big Ten and the Chicagoland area.

              Blais – who currently works as Deputy Director of Athletics in Administration 
              – was also hired in 2010 to work in compliance and academic services and 
              student development, among other departments. Blais also serves as a 
              Deputy Title IX Coordinator during this time, involved with discrimination 
              and harassment prevention, and directly oversees sports like women’s lacrosse, 
              men’s basketball and women’s basketball.

            </span>
            In one of the greatest years in the program’s history, the Wildcats return 
            to national attention and begin what can only be described as the greatest 
            era in Northwestern Athletics. The football team, winning 10 games and 
            finishing at No. 17 in the AP Poll, wins their first bowl game in 64 years, 
            and the women’s lacrosse team wins their seventh national championship. 
            Hype for the Wildcats is at an all-time high, and donors are beginning to 
            notice. Talks begin about potential renovations to the school’s ancient 
            athletic facilities.

            In what was considered to be one of the most important moves in team 
            history, the men’s basketball team receives a new coach: Chris Collins. 
            Collins, who worked under Mike Krzyewski at Duke and helped win two national 
            championships, is seen as one of the top assistants in the country, one 
            that’s desperately needed to whip the team into shape in a top-heavy Big Ten conference.

              THE FOOTBALL TEAM'S EFFORTS TO UNIONIZE:
            </span>
            In January 2014, former Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter, along with Ramogi 
            Huma – founder of the College Athletes Players Association – announces his effort 
            to unionize the Wildcat football team, with union cards signed by almost every 
            current member of the team. According to Colter, the effort comes as a result of 
            trends he noticed while with the team, including small stipends, some students’ 
            failure to graduate and a lack of medical coverage. Colter meets support initially 
            following the filing, including from head football coach Pat Fitzgerald, but once 
            the case is won, the union effort falls through. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href = "https://www.si.com/college/2016/02/24/northwestern-union-case-book-indentured" target = "_blank">Sports Illustrated</a> writes that Fitzgerald announced to players to vote down the 
            union, after initially saying he supported unionization. He tells the team he 
            doesn’t believe the need for a third party between himself and his players is 
            necessary, and the team told players that benefits may be lost if a union is 
            introduced. What’s more, alumni also reportedly call current players and gave 
            threats: their new planned athletic center would fall through, Fitzgerald might 
            leave and their job prospects would be slim. With all this in mind, the union 
            falls through. To this day, it is the only such effort to unionize at a Division I FBS school.

            demonstrators</a> occupy Henry Crown Sports Pavilion, where a ceremony is being 
            held to celebrate the event. Protestors speak directly to Schapiro, in attendance 
            for the ceremony, with a list of demands, feeling that the University president 
            has not done enough to address the institutional issues that Black students face at Northwestern, 
            inspired by other protests around the country, including at the University of Missouri. 
            Following the protest and subsequent departure of protestors, Schapiro and Phillips tell the 
            crowd they are proud of the students for speaking out like they did.

            Among his complaints, Vassar claims the team instead put him on an “internship,” doing 
            janitorial work, and that Collins berated and mistreated him, saying Vassar had no 
            future with the team, and that he “fucking suck[ed]” on one occasion. The lawsuit,

            During the 2017 NFL season, several prominent players kneel 
            or protest during the National Anthem to speak out for racial justice. As the 
            protests spread across America, Black cheerleaders at Northwestern are reportedly 
            told that if they kneel during the mational anthem, <a href = "https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-northwestern-protest-mike-polisky-morton-schapiro-20210508-puvrrtfimrbudnx5ulfvtdjb74-story.html" target = "_blank">they would receive no support</a> 
            from the University – it would be their burden to bear alone. A Northwestern 
            spokesman denied this and told the Chicago Tribune that “The cheerleaders did 
            kneel during the anthem at Ryan Field, multiple times, and were fully supported.”

            coach Pamela Bonnevier,</a> who was fired by the school in Fall 2020. According to 
            the Daily Northwestern, Bonnevier discouraged
            Black cheerleaders from wearing their natural hair, and an official policy prohibited 
            cheerleaders from wearing their hair in braids. They also reportedly could not stand next to their other Black 
            teammates on the sidelines due to “optics.” Communications senior Skyler Maeso said 
            Bonnevier once grabbed her by the hair during a game because her hair wasn’t straight 
            and threatened to bench her. The incident was reported to Polisky, but seemingly no repercussions 
            occurred during the season when the incident took place.

              “mingle with extremely intoxicated fans alone.” This led to sexual harassment 
              from fans. The same practices continued during alumni events, 
              around “men old enough to be their fathers and grandfathers.” A recent comment by 
              Northwestern cheerleader and Weinberg junior Jennifer Pius-Alonee says the practice 
              came to a head when, in San Diego for the 2018 Holiday Bowl, the squad is forced to 
              enter a bar and interact with intoxicated fans.

              FOOTBALL & BASKETBALL TEAMS SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF RACIAL EQUITY

            Following a resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement over the summer of 2020, 
            the men’s and women’s basketball teams, as well as the football team, speak in 
            support of racial equality. They wear shirts communicating the message and 
            participate in protests of the national anthem: the women’s basketball team, for 
            example, does not take the floor during the anthem.

              CHEERLEADING LAWSUIT FILED:</span>
              In late January, cheerleader Hayden Richardson formally files a lawsuit against 
              Northwestern University and Polisky, claiming the school attempted to cover up the 
              complaints of sexual harassment. The 58-page report also says Richardson never 
              received word on the investigation held by the athletics program. The suit is met 
              with support from the Northwestern community, as 80 faculty members, all of whom 
              are women, sign a letter to University leaders expressing their concern and 
              disappointment with the program.

              POLISKY OFFICIALLY HIRED AS NEXT ATHLETIC DIRECTOR:</span>
              On May 2, Mike Polisky is officially hired as Northwestern's new athletic director, 
              despite reports that the search committee recommended against his hiring. In a 
              letter to the community, Schapiro writes that he “felt certain” about hiring Polisky, 
              believing him to be the best candidate based on his “understanding of the University 
              community.” According to Deadspin, Polisky also has a connection to one of the most 
              important donors for the school, Pat Ryan. No press conference is held to discuss 
              the hiring further, as Schapiro is out of town when the announcement is made.

              NU FILES A MOTION TO DISMISS HARASSMENT LAWSUIT:</span>
              On the same day as Polisky’s hiring as AD, the Daily Northwestern reports that 
              Northwestern is attempting to have Richardson’s lawsuit dismissed, with University 
              spokesmen explaining that there is no belief of wrongdoing by Northwestern. In a 
              same message to the community, Schapiro says that “While we respect the right of 
              individuals to seek redress through the legal system, it is important to keep in 
              mind that a lawsuit contains allegations, not necessarily statements of fact.”

              PROTESTERS MARCH TO SCHAPIRO'S HOUSE AND CALL FOR POLISKY'S FIRING:</span>
              On May 7, six Northwestern faculty members hold a protest march along with students 
              and community members in response to Poliksy’s hiring. Present and former members 
              of the cheerleading team speak during the march and raise a demand in front of 
              Schapiro’s house: investigate Polisky and fire him.

              POLISKY RESIGNS:</span>
              On May 12, five days after the protest, Polisky announces in a press brief that he 
              will resign from the position. In the brief, he says that he will not be “effectively” 
              able to lead the department and that he is resigning so he won’t be a distraction 
              to the student athletes as they continue to work. WBEZ reoprted that Polisky 
              told student-athletes and staff that he wished he had “been more empathetic” 
              to the cheerleaders, and that he had a “fix this” mentality rather than an emotional 
              response. Polisky will not be returning to Northwestern.

      <p>
        In 11 years with Northwestern's athletics department, Polisky oversaw some fantastic highs 
        for the program, including the growth of Northwestern sports as a brand and new national 
        opportunities for the Wildcats. There were also patterns of dismissal, however, with the 
        necessity to look for a quick fix and program growth taking priority rather than the safety 
        of student-athletes – which Polisky admitted in his final statement should have been the 
        priority all along. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While it may take time before a new director is finally announced, there is a desire for 
        transparency in the search – something Schapiro has agreed upon. Students, faculty and 
        athletes alike will be watching.
